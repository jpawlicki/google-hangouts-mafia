===============================================================================
WHAT IS DONE WITH THIS INFORMATION?

This software (Spies & Patriots) does not expressly collect *any* information
about you or your machine. This means that the developers do not collect
information about your machine, your personal identity, audio or video feeds,
and so on.

However, use of this software in the context of Google Hangouts means that
Google, Inc. may collect information in accordance with their own privacy
policy (http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). Additionally, in the
normal use of this software, it is necessary to distribute information to
other participants of the game, including the game state (which includes
such information as your Google+ account name, your Google Hangouts audio/
video feed, your Google Hangouts identity, and so forth). These other
participants are not bound by this privacy policy and may record or distribute
this information, possibly without your knowledge or permission, in accordance
to local law.

Additionally, this information may not be encrypted securely during
transmission. If this is the case, a third party may be able to access this
information, record and/or distribute it. The developer(s) again disclaim any
responsibility for information you choose to transmit by using this app, even
in the case that this is due to the negligance or error of the developers in
choosing a transmission medium.

Finally, the user of this software should be aware that normal use of this
software requires one or more downloads from a website. In the normal course of
servicing such a download, the download server may collect or log the user's
IP address, geolocation, appropriate cookies, and such other information that
may or may not be kept securely. The company owning the download service
(currently Google, Inc) is solely responsible for the security and retention of
this information, subject again to that entity's own privacy policy.

Therefore, if you are strongly concerned about the security or privacy of the
aforementioned information, the developer(s) of this software STRONGLY URGE you
to discontinue using this software. The developer(s) disclaim any
responsibility or liability for the privacy or security of any personal
information you expose to this software.

The developer(s) take your informational privacy EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY. We've
done our best to protect you, but the developers are human beings subject to
error. If you have ANY concerns, PLEASE create an issue at
https://code.google.com/p/google-hangouts-mafia/issues/list with the details.
